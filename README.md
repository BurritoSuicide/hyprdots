Hyprland Dotfiles

My dots for Hyprland, including a rainbow border for active windows (animated gradient), two workspaces individually split on each monitor (how it should be), and some general game fixes to bind certain games to one monitor. Feel free to replicate code as needed.

TO DO:

- [ ] Enable fix for ANY game opened via Steam/Lutris/GOG to bind to only one monitor.
- [ ] Add wallpapers to repository.
- [ ] Update Readme.md to include screenshots and mp4 demonstrations of animated borders and be more descriptive overall.
- [ ] Add all packages required to build via Arch.
- [x] Clean up code
